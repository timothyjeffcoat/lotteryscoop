# Lottery Scoop - Track your lottery picks.

An application to manage your personal lottery history. 

You can enter your lottery numbers and keep track of how well they do.

## History

Failing to find a proper application that both manages my current MegaMillions and Powerball lottery picks as well as provide a running history of past selection this application has come into being.
